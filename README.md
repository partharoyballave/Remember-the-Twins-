# Remember-the-Twins-
This program is paired with an Arduino Uno device, breadboard, LEDS and pushbuttons to create a challenging memory game.
The objective of the game is to remember and recreate 4 different combinations of a pair of LEDS in the same order that they lit up.
Everytime the user passes a level, the time between the combinations decreases making it harder for the user to remember.
